    "First experimental evidence for circadian clock genes involvement in bipolar mood disorders (2000, 2004)",
    "Conceptualization of genes involved in psychiatric disorders as being risk genes (psychogenes, by analogy with oncogenes) and protective genes (psychosis-suppressor genes, by analogy to tumor-suppressor genes) (2000)",
    "\"Genes that change (in expression) together (may) work together\": co-acting gene expression groups (CAGE) (2000)",
    "Coined the term phenomics and proposed to use genomic methodologies to study phenotypes, the weakest link in psychiatry (2002)",
    "Agonist and antagonist pharmacogenomics in mouse models for psychiatric disorders, where the interference of drugs provides additional information compared to the single drug treatment arms (2004, 2007, 2011)",
    "Evidence that the repertoire of genes involved in psychiatric disorders is large (thousands of genes) (2004)",
    "Early emphasis on biological pathways and mechanisms as a way of understanding psychiatric disorders and showing reproducibility across studies (2004)",
    "Early emphasis on repositioning of existing drugs using genomics (2004)",
    "Evidence of myelin-related genes being downregulated in expression in animal models of various psychiatric disorders, not just in human postmortem brains, indicating the findings are real and not brain aging-related artefacts, and proposing that demyelination is a common if non-specific denominator of psychiatric disorders (2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011)",
    "Evidence for complexity, heterogeneity, overlap and interdependence at a genomic level between the major psychiatric disorders by mapping the genomic landscape of bipolar disorder, alcoholism, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders (2004, 2006, 2007, 2011)",

    "The first genetic animal model mimicking both phases of bipolar disorder (depression, mania) (2008)",
    "Pioneered the use of fresh whole blood for biomarker work, to make it easy to deploy in the field and to avoid artefacts, as opposed to using purified white blood cells or immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (2008)",
    "First brain-blood studies in animal models to identify candidate biomarkers (2008)",
    "First human blood biomarkers for mood disorders (2008)",
    "First evidence of predictive ability in completely independent cohorts for panels of human blood biomarkers (2008)",

    "First demonstrations of the power of genetic risk prediction scoring (GRPS) with a limited number of highly prioritized candidate genes (2010, 2012)",
    "Making the fundamental argument that reproducibility across studies is more important than p-value in individual studies (\"the p-value illusion\"), due to genetic heterogeneity, and that the SNP level focus of GWASes brings to the fore primarily housekeeping genes (2010)",
